# Food-Carbon-Food-Print-Project
Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices and shape policy.  

In this project we will be exploring food carbon emissions- The environmental impacts of our eating habits.  

Food Carbon Footprint Index 2018 | nu3 Conducted a research on directly comparing different diets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The research, which reveals the annual CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide, shows which countries could significantly reduce their carbon footprint by switching to a plant-based diet, as well as which food types generate the highest carbon dioxide emissions.
